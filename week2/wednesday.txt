JDBC
	- Java Database Connectivity
		- establish a connection between a Java application and a database
			- dependency is database specific
	- Important JDBC classes/interfaces:
		- DriverManager
			- manages the JDBC driver
			- .getConnection()
				- provide connection to db
				- pass in credentials in order to connect
					- hardcoded, file, environment variables 
		- Connection
			- represents the connection to the database
			- .setAutoCommit(boolean)
			- createStatement()
			- commit()
			- rollback()
			- close()
		- Statement
			- represents a SQL statement
			- executeQuery(sql)
			- best used when no user input is required due to vulnerability to SQL injection
		- PreparedStatement
			- represents a SQL statement, that has been pre-processed before its execution and therefore prevents sql injection
			- leverages set methods to parameterize the prepared statement
				- setInt, setString...
			- executeUpdate
		- CallableStatement*
			- calls a function/procedure defined in a database
		- ResultSet
			- result of a query
			- next()
			- retrieve data using .get methods
	- SQL Injection
		- placing malicious code into a sql statement
			- SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE = [userInput];
				- input could be "1; DROP TABLE EMPLOYEES;"
