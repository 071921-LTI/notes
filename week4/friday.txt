DevOps Practices
	- CI
		- Continuous Integration
			- practice of constantly merging source code, often to a centralized location/repository
				- meant to prevent large errors from accumulating
				- make sure that people are working with the latest codebase
	- CD
		- Continuous Delivery
			- Constantly having the application/software in a state to be released "at the push of a button"
				- Staging environment
	- CD
		- Continuous Deployment
			- Code is integrated and if it passes the tests it's sent to the production environment
				- live environment

Maven (review)
	- Build automation tool and dependency management tool
		- dependencies are downloaded locally in the .m2 folder
	- Lifecycle
		- clean - removes old artifacts, aka deletes the target folder
		- default
			- broken down in different phases
				- validate
				- compile
				- test
				- package
				- verify
				- install
				- deploy
		- site - project documentation
