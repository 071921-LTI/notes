Front Controller Design Pattern
		- handles all of the requests
			- rather than handling each endpoint with another servlet
		- delegates tasks to "delegates"
		- centralized control
			- easier to handle
				- sessions
				- validation
				- logging
		- leverages helper to break down the url and route them to the appropriate delegates
