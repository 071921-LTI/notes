# Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
---

SOA is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. The basic principles of service-oriented architecture are independent of vendors, products and technologies. A service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently, such as retrieving a credit card statement online.

A service has four properties according to one of many definitions of SOA:

- Services logically represents a business activity with a specified outcome
- Loosely-coupled; individual services are self-contained and not dependent upon other services
- Abstraction; a black box for its consumers
- It may consist of other underlying services.

## Priorities of SOA

- Business value over technical strategy 
- Strategic goals over project-specific benefits 
- Intrinsic interoperability over custom integration 
- Shared services over specific-purpose implementations 
- Flexibility over optimization 
- Evolutionary refinement over pursuit of initial perfection
