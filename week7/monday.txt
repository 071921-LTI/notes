Vertical Scaling
	- Providing more "power"/ resources to an application

Horizontal Scaling
	- Providing more instances of an application

Microservice Architecture (MSA)
	- breaking down monolithic applications into smaller independent services
		- promotes decoupling
	- Monolith vs MSA
		- Monolith
			- System simplicity
			- More centralized control
			- Less network traffic
			- ACID Transaction
		- MSA
			- More efficient resource allocation and scalalability
				- scale specific aspect of the application rather than the whole
			- modularity
				- decoupling
				- easy to replace/upgrade
				- no longer tied to a particular tech stack
					- ie: if all sevices are RESTful, techstack no longer matters
			- Eventual consistency
				- multiple dbs might need to be updated by a request
				- lack of transactional operation(ACID)
					- BASE ( Basic Availabilty, Soft state, Eventual consistency)
			- Higher fault tolerance
				- if one instance goes down, it does not take down the whole application
			- complex architecture
			- Chatty interfaces
				- lot of interservice communication over a network

Spring Cloud
	- Spring project, designed to address the "issues" related to MSA
		- provides implementation for design patterns solving these issues
		- Service Discovery/Registration
		- API Gateway
		- Circuit breaking
		- Load Balancing
		- Central Config
